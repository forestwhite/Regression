# Regression

R markdown (R) and Jupyter (python) notebooks detailing regression functionality grouped by functions. The functionality demonstrated in each language is in the following files:

1. __1_SLR_SumSqs_R_fkingfisher.*__ : simple linear regression model example with automatic and manual calculations for sums of squares (total, error, regression/response) and coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>)
2. __2_SLR_Significance_Confidence_fkingfisher.*__ : simple linear regression model example with automatic and manual calculations to test model signficance (t and F test), a slope coefficient hypothesis test (t test), confidence and prediction intervals at a specific predictor variable value, and plots of prediction and interval ranges on a scatter plot.
